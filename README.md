**California Housing Dataset - Regression Analysis**
**Overview**
This repository provides a comprehensive analysis of the California Housing dataset, focusing on supervised learning for regression tasks. The primary goal is to predict housing prices based on various attributes of the housing units in California.

**Contents**

**Business Understanding**
**Problem Statement:** Predict the target variable (housing prices) based on various features in the dataset.

**Importance:** Helps in understanding factors influencing housing prices, aiding in better decision-making and strategic planning.

**Data Source**
The dataset, named california.csv, is sourced from Kaggle and includes features such as median income, house age, average rooms, average bedrooms, population, average household members, latitude, and longitude.
Data Preparation

**Handling Missing Values:** Missing values were handled by deletion.

**Data Splitting:** The data was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

**Methodology**
**Model Selection:** Implemented algorithms include RandomForestRegressor, ExtraTreeRegressor, and DecisionTreeRegressor.

**Evaluation Metrics:** Models were evaluated using error rates and predictive accuracy.

**Results**
**Best Model:** RandomForestRegressor with an error rate of 0.33.

**Conclusions:** Highlights the significance of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the use of model evaluation metrics.

**Future Work**
Suggestions for improvements include adding more features and employing advanced techniques like ensemble learning to enhance model performance.
